**Task B. Creating a custom HTML web map page with ESRI ArcGIS Javascript SDK.**

1. Think of a theme for the custom web map – something that you personally find
   interesting in terms of data and representation.
2. Find and use open data: you would gather publicly available data, from open data
   portals like government or community repositories (census data, OpenStreetMap,
   etc.). The data should align with the theme of the story map you're creating. No big
   datasets are needed.
3. Create an engaging narrative. Please structure the data into an interesting narrative.
   The goal of the map is to show the data in an engaging way, so you would need to
   weave data, maps, and multimedia into a cohesive and compelling narrative.
4. You can “store” the data in (local) GeoJSON or similar formats, no database is
   needed at this point. You are free to use the existing ArcGIS Service if you have
   your own.
5. You would have to use ArcGIS JavaScript SDK tools to create a map view and
   visualise the map content inside of it. You are free to choose the code editor (IntelliJ,
   Visual Studio, etc.) – anything that is comfortable for developing HTML, JavaScript,
   CSS etc. The work process will involve:
   ● Creating custom maps, layers, and visualisations.
   ● Using symbology, charts, and pop-ups to make the data more
   understandable (suggested).
   ● Geospatial analysis, if applicable (e.g., proximity, density, or time series
   analysis).
6. Sharing your result:
    * A) You can build a separate web page and use (public) hosting and share the
      URL of the web map.
    * B) ~~You can compress the webpage folder and share the ZIP file with us via
      Dropbox or other cloud drive. The compressed file must include all HTML.~~[index.html](../Downloads/core-sample-jsapi-react%20%281%29/index.html)
